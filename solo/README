Rather than using Chef Server, we can just build nodes with Chef Solo.

Vanilla Chef install
--------------------

For Ubuntu based systems:
From http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Package+Installation+on+Debian+and+Ubuntu

% echo "deb http://apt.opscode.com/ `lsb_release -cs`-0.10 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list
% wget -qO - http://apt.opscode.com/packages@opscode.com.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
% sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y chef

For Red Hat based systems (Oracle Linux)

From http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Workstation+Setup+for+CentOS,+Red+Hat,+Fedora

Setup vcloud user with pwd less sudo. Add your laptop's ssh key to its auth-keys

Usage
* Push the cookbooks/roles/scripts to the node (sync-solo.sh)
* run the chef-solo.sh script on the node. 

BUGS and Manual Steps:
Need to configure repo for sun java 6: http://leo.gaggl.com/2011/10/installing-java6-jdk-on-ubuntu-11-10/

I needed to manually run the following to fix SSH key permissions (should be fixed now):
sudo chown vcloud:tomcat6 etc/ssh-key.pem*
sudo chmod g+r etc/ssh-key.pem*

set vcloud user's key as authorized for builder user.
copy /home/vcloud/.ssh/id_rsa.pub on the main to /etc/ssh/builder/authorized_keys on the build machine

setup logs permissions:
sudo chmod g+rx /var/log/tomcat6/
